# Multimedia Video Player using GStreamer and Qt Creator

This project is a multimedia video player application built using the Qt 6.7 framework, GStreamer as the multimedia backend, and CMake as the build system. It targets Windows using MSVC 2019 as the compiler and Ninja as the build tool. The application progressively implements more complex video player features, starting from playing a single video to handling multiple video streams simultaneously.
